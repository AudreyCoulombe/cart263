Artist's Statement

As it is explained in James Bridle's essay Something is wrong on the internet, there are thousands of videos on YouTube Kids (and other platforms) that are created by bots. We have come to a point where we can’t make the difference between human made and computer-generated content. “These videos, wherever they are made, however they come to be made, and whatever their conscious intention (i.e. to accumulate ad revenue) are feeding upon a system which was consciously intended to show videos to children for profit. The unconsciously-generated, emergent outcomes of that are all over the place”. The problem is that algorithms sometimes make mistakes which can lead to weird results. And with all the creepy content we can find on YouTube Kids, we know its verification system isn’t effective.

That gave me the idea to create a “game” where you have to click buttons to easily generate characters for kids in order to get money. I decided to make it similar to a slot machine to recall the idea that, when a child watches YouTube Kids on auto play, it is kind of like gambling because you never know if what you are going to get is safe for children and if it is made by humans or bots. Also, just like gambling, the motivation behind bot generated videos is getting money.

Also, what inspired me to do this “game” is the fact that, on YouTube Kids, you can find so many times the same video animation where the only difference is the characters in it (for example, just type “wrong heads” in YouTube’s search bar). It made me think they (either humans or bots) must copy the most popular animations and simply slide in new characters and make money out of it by posting the new video on YouTube. I then made the “game” like if it was made for this purpose.

Another thing that James Bridle denounced in his essay is “the constant overlaying and intermixing of different tropes”. To amplify that, I chose to use body parts of existing characters for kids so the final characters mix them all together.

To reflect the fact that algorithms make mistakes and that bot generated content isn’t always appropriate, I added body parts that are not meant for children. For example, I added the head of Momo, a character that targets young children and ask them to do strange and dangerous things. I also added the body of a warrior with an axe as weapon and the legs of a woman wearing sexy underwear.

Moreover, I animated the gained coins and added cash register sounds to amplify the fact that money is the motivation behind those contents created by bots.

For the spinning sound, I used Pizzicato to generate random sounds at the same rhythm than the body parts are spinning, resulting in a sound similar to the one made by digital slot machines.

To make the game more interesting, I decided to display a miniaturized version of the created characters so the player can keep track of all his/her “creations”.

Finally, I chose bright colours to recall those in the videos that are critiqued in the essay.
